# mech-interp
Repository for learning/experimenting with mechanistic interpretability.

We will be following Neel Nanda's guidelines on building skills in mechanistic interpretability. 

[Stage 1: Learning the Rope](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/jP9KDyMkchuv6tHwm/how-to-become-a-mechanistic-interpretability-researcher#Stage_1__Learning_the_Ropes)

[Stage 2: Mini-Projects](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/jP9KDyMkchuv6tHwm/how-to-become-a-mechanistic-interpretability-researcher#Stage_2__Practicing_Research_with_Mini_Projects)

[Stage 3: Full Projects](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/jP9KDyMkchuv6tHwm/how-to-become-a-mechanistic-interpretability-researcher#Stage_3__Working_Up_To_Full_Research_Projects)


The whole process is designed to take approximately 2 months to get through stages 1 and 2 and then stage 3 is designed to be ongoing work.

This repository will be self-documenting and is intended to hold us accountable for making progress.
