# mech-interp

Repository for learning/experimenting with mechanistic interpretability.

We will be following Neel Nanda's guidelines on building skills in mechanistic interpretability.

[Stage 1: Learning the Rope](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/jP9KDyMkchuv6tHwm/how-to-become-a-mechanistic-interpretability-researcher#Stage_1__Learning_the_Ropes)

[Stage 2: Mini-Projects](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/jP9KDyMkchuv6tHwm/how-to-become-a-mechanistic-interpretability-researcher#Stage_2__Practicing_Research_with_Mini_Projects)

[Stage 3: Full Projects](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/jP9KDyMkchuv6tHwm/how-to-become-a-mechanistic-interpretability-researcher#Stage_3__Working_Up_To_Full_Research_Projects)

The whole process is designed to take approximately 2 months to get through stages 1 and 2 and then stage 3 is designed to be ongoing work.

This repository will be self-documenting and is intended to hold us accountable for making progress.

## Initializing

You will need to create a subdirectory for yourself with stage_1 and stage_2 subdirectories for organization.

Within subdirectories, you can run `uv init` to initialize [Astral's uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) an efficient and easy-to-use package manager written in Rust.
